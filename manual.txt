1.What the program does
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You want to build your own cryptocurrencies but you do not know
  where to start? 
  With Build-Your-Own-Altcoin Cryptocurrency Creator you can create your
  altcoins with a few mouse clicks. You save at least a few hours or even days
  of work even if you are a developer. 
  If you are not a developer you can start your own altcoin without the need to
  change any program code.
  If you need further help in the creation of your altcoin you can contact us and
  we will help you.
  You can customize many things in the program. The program uses the Bitcoin
  v0.17.1 source code as a basis. 
  You can customize the following things: name, symbol, block time, difficulty retargeting interval,
  subsidy halfing interval, block reward, premine, maximum block size, ports, seed ip,
  dnsseeder, address version bytes.
  You can replace the pictures in two of the folders to use your own logo for the coin.
  You can compile the coin on your own, which is not very hard, only a few lines
  of code to copy and paste. But if you need help with that step, we offer this as a service
  for a small fee too.
  We also offer to help you with all other steps like creating an explorer, mining pool, dnsseeder etc. 
  for a small fee.
  We are not responsible for any loss of funds or any damage due to errors
  in the program source code. This program uses the Bitcoin source code
  as a basis which is open source.
